# 1. 목표
- 컴퓨터 네트워크의 계층적인 프로토콜 구조를 이해
- 인터넷에서 사용되고 있는 응용 프로그램, 트랜스포트 프로토콜, 라우팅 알고리즘과 프로토콜에 대해 집중적으로 학습
- 네트워크의 자원 활용율을 높이고 사용자에 대한 서비스를 향상시킬 수 있는 네트워크 프로토콜 설계 및 분석 능력 배양

# 2. What’s the internet: “nuts and bolts” view
- millions of connected computing devices: host= end systems, running network apps
- communication links(라우터와 스위치, 호스트들을 이어주는 물리적인 선)
  - fiber, copper, radio, satelite
  - transmission rate: bandwidth
- packet switches: forward packets (chunks of data)
  - routers and switches
- Internet: “network of networks”
  - Interconnected ISPs
- Protocols control sending, receiving of messages -> 표준화가 매우 중요하다.
  - e.g. TCP, IP, HTTP, Skype, 802.11
- Internet standards
  - RFC: Request For Comments
  - IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force

# 3. What is a protocol?
- protocols define **format, order of messages sent and received** among network entities, and **actions taken** on message transmission, receipt
- human protocols
  - what is the time, I have a question, introductions, …
- network protocols
  - machines rather than humans
  - all communication activity in Internet governed by protocols


# 4. A closer look at network structure
- network edge
  - hosts: clients and servers
  - servers often in data centers
- access networks, physical media
  - wired, wireless communication links
- network core
  - interconnected routers
  - network of networks

# 5. Access networks and physical media
- How to connect end systems to edge router?
  - residential access nets
  - institutional access networks (school. Company, etc.)
  - mobile access networks
- keep in mind: 1) bandwidth (bps) of access network, 2) shared or dedicated

# 6. Host: sends packets of data
- host sending function
  - takes application message
  - breaks into smaller chunks, known as packets, of length L bits
  - transmits packet into access network at transmission rate R (= link transmission rate, link capacity, link bandwidth)
- packet transmission delay = time needed to transmit L-bit packet into link = L(bits) / R(bits/sec)

# 7. Physical media
- bit: propagates between transmitter/receiver pairs
- physical link: what lies between transmitter and receiver
- guided media: signals propagate in solid media - copper, fiber, coax(HFC들)
- unguided media: signals propagate freely like radio, wifi, cellular

### coaxial cable
- two concentric copper conductors
- bidirectional
- broadband: multiple channels on cable, HFC

### fiber optic cable
- glass fiber carrying light pulses, each pulse a bit
- high speed operation
- Low error rate: repeaters spaced far apart, immune to electromagnetic noise

### radio
- signal carried in electromagnetic spectrum
- no physical wire
- bidirectional
- propagation environment effects: reflection, obstruction by objects, interference

# 8. Circuit switching
- end to end resources allocated to, reserved for call between source and dest

# 4. Network core


# 5. Delay, loss, throughput in networks


# 6. Protocol layers, service models


# 7. Networks under attack: security
