# 1. Introduction to branch-and-bound
- Bound value is the upper limit of the optimization variable which is obtained by expanding the node.
- The bound of a node enables us to determine whether the node is promising.
- If bound value is not better than the value of the best optimal value found so far, the node is non-promising. Otherwise, the node is promising.
- Best optimal refers to minimum in some problems and maximum in other problems. -> Hence, better means smaller or larger
